# Organization-Projects
Some fun projects that help organize things in my home/life.


# Project Prerequisites 

if you are having trouble installing tkinter on Linux/MAc/similar variant, try running the following:

``` sudo apt-get install python3-tk ```

It is not a pip package and cannot be installed this way.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
***Every code I ran to set up my environment. I will properly organize this at a later time.***

``` sudo apt-get install python3-tk ```
``` sudo apt install mysql-server ```

Ran this because I got an ImportError: cannot import name 'ImageTK":
``` sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk ```
